  We promise you we wont hide your data from you and will always give you some way to open and edit that data, at no cost. When companies pay us money it should be because we add value, not because they are locked in.


  We are disrupting the industry with a new business model that makes reasonable profits to pay a dedicated, professional software team, but doesnt use artificial scarcity to produce a bloated sales-centric company with matching revenues.


  Our mission statement is “provide free, high quality diagramming software for everyone”.
