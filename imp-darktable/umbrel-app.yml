tagline: open source photography workflow application and raw developer
description: >-
  darktable is an open source photography workflow application and non-destructive raw developer - a virtual lighttable and darkroom for photographers.


  It manages your digital negatives in a database, lets you view them through a zoomable lighttable and enables you to develop raw images, enhance them and export them to local or remote storage.


  *darktable is not a free Adobe® Lightroom® replacement.


  Note:darktable can run on lightweight configurations (even on a Raspberry Pi), but expect modules like denoise, local contrast, contrast equalizer, retouch or liquify to be slow beyond usable.
